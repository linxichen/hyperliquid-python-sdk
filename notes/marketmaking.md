# Hyperliquid Market Making Study

## Executive Summary

Hyperliquid implements a **purely algorithmic market making incentive system** based on transparent, volume-based negative maker fees. Unlike traditional exchanges with negotiated MM programs, Hyperliquid's system is permissionless and automatically scales with market share performance.

## Key Mechanisms

### 1. Maker Rebate System
- **Threshold**: 0.5% of **maker volume** (not total volume)
- **Rebate Rate**: -0.001% (-0.1 basis points) 
- **Mechanism**: Automatic via `makerFractionCutoff` parameter in API
- **Payment**: Instant credit per trade, no claiming needed

### 2. Base Fee Structure
- **Perpetuals**: Maker 0.015%, Taker 0.045%
- **Spot**: Maker 0.04%, Taker 0.07%
- **Spot volume counts 2x** toward VIP tiers

### 3. Staking Discount System
- **Range**: 5% to 40% discount on base fees
- **Diamond Tier**: 40% discount (500k+ HYPE staked)
- **Stackable**: Applied after volume tier reductions

### 4. Volume-Tier Discounts
- **Tier 1**: â‰¥$5M 14-day volume â†’ Maker 0.012%, Taker 0.04%
- **Progressive**: Higher tiers reduce both maker and taker fees

## Mathematical Framework

### Effective Fee Calculation
```python
effective_maker_rate = max(
    base_maker_rate Ã— (1 - volume_discount) Ã— (1 - staking_discount) Ã— (1 - referral_discount) + maker_rebate,
    maker_rebate  # Floor at rebate rate
)
```

### Revenue Example (Diamond tier, 1% maker share)
```python
daily_volume = 1_000_000  # $1M daily volume
maker_rebate = 0.00001    # 0.001%
daily_revenue = daily_volume Ã— maker_rebate  # $10 per $1M
annual_revenue = $3,650 per $1M daily volume
```

## API Integration

### Key Endpoint
```http
POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type": "userFees",
  "user": "0x..."
}
```

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "feeSchedule": {
    "add": "0.00015",           // Base maker fee
    "cross": "0.00045",         // Base taker fee
    "tiers": {
      "mm": [{                    // Market maker rebates
        "makerFractionCutoff": "0.005",
        "add": "-0.00001"
      }]
    }
  },
  "userAddRate": "0.000105",     // Your effective maker rate
  "userCrossRate": "0.000315",   // Your effective taker rate
  "activeStakingDiscount": {
    "discount": "0.3"            // 30% discount if applicable
  }
}
```

## Business Strategy

### Competitive Advantages
1. **No collateral requirements** - capital efficient
2. **Transparent mechanics** - all rates visible via API
3. **Automatic scaling** - revenue grows with market share
4. **Instant rebates** - no claiming or delays

### Market Share Dynamics
- **<0.5% maker share**: Pay reduced fees, compete on spread
- **â‰¥0.5% maker share**: Earn rebates, can quote tighter
- **Network effects**: Larger MMs afford tighter spreads due to rebate income

### Break-Even Analysis
For a market with $500M daily volume:
- **1% maker share**: $5M daily volume
- **Daily rebate**: $50 (at 0.001% rebate)
- **Annual revenue**: $18,250 pure rebate income
- **Additional revenue**: Tighter spreads capture more flow

## Implementation Considerations

### Risk Management
- **Inventory risk**: Must manage position exposure
- **Adverse selection**: Rebate doesn't protect against toxic flow
- **Competition**: 23 wallets currently qualify for enhanced rebates

### Technology Requirements
- **Low latency**: Need competitive execution to capture flow
- **Inventory management**: Dynamic position sizing
- **Market making algorithms**: Must optimize for both spreads and volume share

## Verification Status

### âœ… Officially Confirmed
- Maker rebate mechanism via API documentation
- Base fee structure from official sources
- Staking discount tiers from 2025 implementation
- Mathematical formulas validated against API responses

### ðŸ“Š Cross-Referenced Sources
1. **Primary**: Hyperliquid GitBook API Documentation
2. **Staking**: DeFi Planet (April 29, 2025 implementation)
3. **Market data**: BlockBase Insights (23 qualifying wallets)

## Conclusion

Hyperliquid's market making system represents a **paradigm shift** from relationship-based to **performance-based liquidity provision**. The mathematical elegance lies in its simplicity: successful market makers are automatically rewarded through transparent, algorithmic mechanisms that create positive-sum dynamics between efficient MMs and the broader trading ecosystem.

The system is particularly attractive for **algorithmic traders** who can optimize for volume share rather than negotiating bilateral agreements, making it one of the most **capital-efficient market making opportunities** in the current landscape.
