# Hyperliquid Market Making Study 📊

## Executive Summary 📈

Hyperliquid implements a *purely algorithmic market making incentive system* based on transparent, volume\-based negative maker fees\. Unlike traditional exchanges with negotiated MM programs, Hyperliquid's system is permissionless and automatically scales with market share performance\.

## Key Mechanisms ⚙️

### 1\. Maker Rebate System 💰
\- **Threshold**: 0\.5\% of *maker volume* \(not total volume\)\n\- **Rebate Rate**: \-0\.001\% \(\-0\.1 basis points\) \n\- **Mechanism**: Automatic via `makerFractionCutoff` parameter in API
\- **Payment**: Instant credit per trade, no claiming needed

### 2\. Base Fee Structure 💳
\- **Perpetuals**: Maker 0\.015\%, Taker 0\.045\%
\- **Spot**: Maker 0\.04\%, Taker 0\.07\%
\- **Spot volume counts 2×** toward VIP tiers

### 3\. Staking Discount System 🎯
\- **Range**: 5\% to 40\% discount on base fees
\- **Diamond Tier**: 40\% discount \(500k\+ HYPE staked\)
\- **Stackable**: Applied after volume tier reductions

### 4\. Volume\-Tier Discounts 📊
\- **Tier 1**: ≥$5M 14\-day volume → Maker 0\.012\%, Taker 0\.04\%
\- **Progressive**: Higher tiers reduce both maker and taker fees

## Mathematical Framework 🧮

### Effective Fee Calculation
```python
effective\_maker\_rate = max\(
    base\_maker\_rate × \(1 \- volume\_discount\) × \(1 \- staking\_discount\) × \(1 \- referral\_discount\)


    maker\_rebate,
    maker\_rebate  # Floor at rebate rate
\)
```

### Revenue Example 💎 \(Diamond tier, 1\% maker share\)
```python
daily\_volume = 1\_000\_000  # $1M daily volume
maker\_rebate = 0\.00001    # 0\.001\%
daily\_revenue = daily\_volume × maker\_rebate  # $10 per $1M
annual\_revenue = $3,650 per $1M daily volume
```

## API Integration 🔗

### Key Endpoint
```http
POST https://api.hyperliquid.xyz/info
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "type":"userFees",
  "user":"0x..."
}
```

### Response Structure 📋
```json
{
  "feeSchedule": {
    "add": "0.00015",           // Base maker fee
    "cross": "0.00045",         // Base taker fee
    "tiers": {
      "mm": [{                    // Market maker rebates
        "makerFractionCutoff": "0.005",
        "add": "-0.00001"
      }]
    }
  },
  "userAddRate": "0.000105",     // Your effective maker rate
  "userCrossRate": "0.000315",   // Your effective taker rate
  "activeStakingDiscount": {
    "discount": "0.3"            // 30% discount if applicable
  }
}
```

## Business Strategy 🎯

### Competitive Advantages ✅
1\. **No collateral requirements** \- capital efficient
2\. **Transparent mechanics** \- all rates visible via API
3\. **Automatic scaling** \- revenue grows with market share
4\. **Instant rebates** \- no claiming or delays

### Market Share Dynamics 📈
\- **\<0\.5\% maker share**: Pay reduced fees, compete on spread
\- **≥0\.5\% maker share**: Earn rebates, can quote tighter
\- **Network effects**: Larger MMs afford tighter spreads due to rebate income

### Break\-Even Analysis 💰
For a market with $500M daily volume:
\- **1\% maker share**: $5M daily volume
\- **Daily rebate**: $50 \(at 0\.001\% rebate\)
\- **Annual revenue**: $18,250 pure rebate income
\- **Additional revenue**: Tighter spreads capture more flow

## Implementation Considerations ⚠️

### Risk Management 🛡️
\- **Inventory risk**: Must manage position exposure
\- **Adverse selection**: Rebate doesn't protect against toxic flow
\- **Competition**: 23 wallets currently qualify for enhanced rebates

### Technology Requirements 💻
\- **Low latency**: Need competitive execution to capture flow
\- **Inventory management**: Dynamic position sizing
\- **Market making algorithms**: Must optimize for both spreads and volume share

## Verification Status ✅

### Officially Confirmed 📋
\- Maker rebate mechanism via API documentation
\- Base fee structure from official sources
\- Staking discount tiers from 2025 implementation
\- Mathematical formulas validated against API responses

### Cross\-Referenced Sources 📚
1\. **Primary**: Hyperliquid GitBook API Documentation
2\. **Staking**: DeFi Planet \(April 29, 2025 implementation\)
3\. **Market data**: BlockBase Insights \(23 qualifying wallets\)

## Key Takeaways 🎯

Hyperliquid's market making system represents a *paradigm shift* from relationship\-based to *performance\-based liquidity provision*\. The mathematical elegance lies in its simplicity: successful market makers are automatically rewarded through transparent, algorithmic mechanisms that create positive\-sum dynamics between efficient MMs and the broader trading ecosystem\.

The system is particularly attractive for *algorithmic traders* who can optimize for volume share rather than negotiating bilateral agreements, making it one of the most *capital\-efficient market making opportunities* in the current landscape\.

## Telegram\-Specific Notes 📱

This analysis is based on verified API documentation and cross\-referenced sources\. The rebate rate of 0\.1 basis points applies to the *notional value of each trade* where you're the maker\. For questions or deeper analysis, refer to the full study in the notes folder\.
